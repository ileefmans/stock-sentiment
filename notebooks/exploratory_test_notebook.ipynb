      "Hopefully this was the week where baby apes learned not to dump money into Insanely expensive and risky OTM calls. Especially with such Insanely high implied volatility. Would you buy a gas station scratch ticket for $2,000 if the max jackpot was only like 5-10 grand? Liquidity is so low rn that dude who spent 90k on calls could've just bought shares and it would've had a pretty nice impact on price. How many 10s of millions of dollars did retail traders just dump directly into the pockets of the very same Market Makers who are fucking us? Wasn't too difficult for them to keep the price at $260 (the exact price where the most Calls AND puts finish OTM) with only 22 mil volume and negligible upward pressure. There were about 80,000 800cs bought this week. At an average price of $500 per, guess how much cash that is?.... $40,000,000. Hundreds of millions were spent on strike prices over $300. The ironic thing is we would've easily finished over $300 today if that money was spent on actual shares.\n",

      "\n",
      "&nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "- Over the weekend, the **Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package**. The bill included $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify. The House of Representatives voted on Wednesday, and in the end, the stimmy was passed! I guess this shit was already priced in, cause literally nothing happened after the news came out. Unlucky.\n",
      "- Cathy Wood and the Tech Bros absolutely fucked it up on Women’s Day, with **QQQ** breaching the $300 level for the first time since November, and **ARKK** going out in a blaze of glory, closing the day down 6%. Shares of Apple and other tech giants were near 3-month lows on Monday, providing an awesome opportunity to open a safe, long term position. Luckily for us Bulls, people decided to BTFD, and stocks roared back Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq recording its best day since April 2020.\n",
      "- Oil, Energy, Financials, Telecomms, and other boomer shit seemed resistant to the red. All sectors continued their month long melt-up, netting handsome gains to those who were patient. My personal favourite ticker, **$XLF**, closed the week up 2.5%, netting a stress free 100% gain on my options. You know, maybe these boomers are onto something.\n",
      "- **$GME** started doing it’s thing again after it was revealed that [Chewy’s Cohen was Tapped for E-Commerce Shift](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-08/gamestop-said-to-tap-chewy-com-s-cohen-to-lead-e-commerce-shift). I don’t even know what getting tapped means, but I guess it’s a good thing? GME opened the week in the low $150s, promptly rising up to $340, before butthurt hedge funds shook out all the paper hands on Wednesday. GME dropped down to $170, but ultimately closed Wednesday at $240. Shorting GME seemed to be about as effective as throwing a flash bang at Helen Keller, since it still closed the week around $265 anyways, marking a near 100% gain. Congratulations to all you diamond handed chimpanzees, y’all deserve it.\n",
      "- **On Tuesday, insiders were finally allowed to sell their shares of DASH**. Expecting a massive selloff, people were loaded to the tits on puts, and they were printing. On Monday, DASH finally breached the impenetrable $140 level, closing the day at $133. People were euphoric, but not for long. On Tuesday, DASH gang got absolutely mugged, with Softbank pumping DASH back above $140, and pinning it there. Gains were evaporated, with contracts turning to ash. Pour one out for our homies. The play was fundamentally sound, but Softbank was just too fucking strong. DASH closed out the week at $142.\n",
      "- **$RBLX was “directly-listed” on the NYSE on Wednesday**, with retail investors getting the short end of the stick. I say “directly-listed”, cause it was basically a shoddy IPO. It was set to open at 45$ (lol), but obviously didn’t, getting to the markets at the ripe price of 70 fucking dollars. I didn’t play, my buddies didn’t play, nobody played. I’m genuinely shocked that we somehow managed to get fucked over on a direct listing, but here we are. Retail got robbed yet again. RBLX closed the week out at the same price it got to the markets at; $70. Congrats to those who managed to swing trade it successfully!\n",
      "- In general, throughout the week, stocks mostly traded higher, after new data released Wednesday showed **muted levels of inflation** in consumer goods, helping quell fears of a rapid jump in prices during the economic recovery. **Treasury yields retreated** following the report. **The 10-year Treasury yield is at 1.672%** at the time of writing. Pretty boring info tbh, but it helped get stuff rolling again. For most of the week, SPY was sexually attracted to, and equally disgusted by 390, with it finally rocketing past it on Thursday, creating a new ATH of $394. It seems as if the 24hr news cycle has made everyone's attention span too short for a bear market, as all problems are forgotten within a week. Nothing matters anymore.\n",
